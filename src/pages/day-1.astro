const explanation = "Accessibility isn't an optional add-on or a nice-to-have feature. It's a basic human right that ensures everyone can participate fully in our digital world. When we treat accessibility as a fundamental right, we shift from a mindset of compliance to one of inclusion and equity.";
const businessImpact = "Companies that recognize accessibility as a fundamental right build stronger brand loyalty, reach untapped markets (15% of the global population has a disability), and avoid costly legal issues. This mindset shift leads to better products that work for everyone.";
const actionItems = [
  "Review your company's mission statement - does it include accessibility as a core value?",
  "Audit your current products for accessibility barriers",
  "Establish accessibility as a requirement, not an afterthought, in your development process",
  "Educate your team on accessibility as a human right, not just a technical requirement"
